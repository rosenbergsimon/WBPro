      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>WBPro is a program designed to save time and paper in completing weight-and-balance, and other forms before flights. For the weight-and-balance process, it allows you to enter the aircraft loading information,
        verify the aircraft loading is correct, and upload the completed form to either a lesson attachment, or booking attachment, but at the click of only a few buttons.
        This program is designed to be used for students who already have strong knowledge of aircraft weight and balance in order to save some time; therefore new students 
        should learn do fill out the paper forms before using this program. The program allows for additional implementation of other forms used by a flight school. <br><br>
        Note: The PIC is solely responsible for ensuring their aircraft is loaded in an airworthy manner.

      <h2>How to Use</h2>
      <p>1. Navigate the menus to Weight and Balance, and click on the specific aircraft model you will be flying. <br>
      2. Select your aircraft ident from the drop-down menu, and fill in the loading information below. <br>
      3. Click on the Calculate button, and review the W/B form and fuel endurance upon landing to the right. <br>
      4. If the loading is within limits, click on the Upload button, and select your name below. <br>
      5. Once you have selected your name, enter a name for the document. (This appears on FlightLogger). If doing multiple legs on a flight, choose a suitable name, such as the routing for an xc flight. <br>
      6. Once clicking OK, the bar below should turn yellow as the weight and balance form is uploaded to FlightLogger. <br>
      7. If the upload is successful, a pop-up should appear indicating so. If you go into the FlightLogger lesson corresponding with your lesson, you will see the completed form there. <br>
      8. If entering multiple legs for a cross-country, you may type in the new loading information, re-click calculate and upload, and repeat without restarting the program. <br><br>
      The other forms follow a similar, user-friendly procedure. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="issues">
      <h2>Common Issues</h2>
      <p>This program relies on a slow process to upload documents to FlightLogger. It may take some time to upload them. <br><br>
      The program should give pop-up messages for most errors, either user-caused or issues with FlightLogger connections. <br><br>
      Ensure you have selected the correct aircraft ident. If not, issues will result with your name showing up to upload. <br><br>
      Ensure your instructor has attached a lesson to the booking, if not, uploading will not be possible. <br><br>
      If an error occurs during the FlightLogger uploading process, follow the prompt, and try again if that is suggested.<br><br>
      Please report any other bugs through a FlightLogger message, or through dispatch.
